# Decisions
- How should I structure functions, which will, in most circumstances, take
several parameters directly from the config? Right now, the functions do not take
a config as an option, and instead require each parameter to manually input. I
could make multiple methods for these functions, so that they can take a config,
and I do not believe that this would lead to a slippery slope of too many methods. 

# Large Changes


# Small Changes

- potentially optimize mutate_genotype!() by finding all potential locations,
and sampling from those, rather than drawing random samples until a valid location
is found. Viability of this optimization depends on findall speed, but would likely
be effective, and would avoid randomness in runtime.

- a "change" mutation currently inverts the weight, rather than drawing a new weight
a potential improvement would be to simply draw a new interaction from the sample
iff the interaction is not binary or to have the change property be a config
